# Stack
Stack is a data structure in which in which insertion and deletion are done at one end, called top.

### LIFO
Last element inserted is the first element to be deleted. Hence, it is called **Last in First Out (LIFO)** 
or **First in Last Out (FILO)**.

### Operations on stack
**Push:** Insering an element in stack.</br>
**Pop:** Deleting an element from stack.

### Conditions to lookout for:
**Underflow**: Trying to pop an element from an empty stack.</br>
**Overflow**: Trying to push an element in a full stack.

### Performance:
**Time Complexity**</br>
**Push**:      O(1)</br>       
**Pop**:       O(1)</br>
**isEmpty**:   O(1)</br>
**isFull**:    O(1)</br>
**getTop**:    O(1)</br>
**size**:      O(1)</br>

**Space Complexity**: O(n)</br>
