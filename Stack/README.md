# Stack
Stack is a data structure in which in which insertion and deletion are done at one end, called top.

### LIFO
Last element inserted is the first element to be deleted. Hence, it is called **Last in First Out (LIFO)** 
or **First in Last Out (FILO)**.

### Conditions to lookout for:
**Underflow**: Trying to remove an element from an empty queue.</br>
**Overflow**: Trying to insert an element in a full queue.

### Operations on stack
**Push:** Insering an element in stack.</br>
**Pop:** Deleting an element from stack.

### Performance
**Time Complexity**

**enQueue**:O(1)</br>
**deQueue**:O(1)</br>
**isEmpty**:O(1)</br>
**isFull**:O(1)</br>

**Space Complexity**: O(n)
