# Queue
Queue is an ordered list in which insertion is done at one end called rear and deletions at other end called front.

# FIFO
The first element inserted is the first one to be deleted. Hence, it is called First In First Out(FIFO) or Last In Last Out(LILO).

# Operations on Queue
enQueue: Insert an element in queue.
deQueue: Delete an element from queue.
